# SUMO-Gym Contribution Guidelines

At this time we are currently accepting the current forms of contributions:

- Bug reports (keep in mind that changing environment behavior should be minimized as that requires releasing a new version of the environment and makes results hard to compare across versions)
- Pull requests for bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
